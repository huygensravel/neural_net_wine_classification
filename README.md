# Wine Classification using Neural Network.
Author: Huygens Ravelomanana
# Description
Using wine data from [googleapis](https://storage.googleapis.com/nicksdemobucket/wines.csv), we build and train a small neural network that classifies different types of wine.<br>
We evaluate the model on test (unseen) data and got accuracy and f1-scores around 94%.
